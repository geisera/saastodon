# A Thousand Words for Fear

A duo of assassins is on a mission to murder a contender to the throne in a looming ascension war. When the target is revealed to be a six year old child, the senior assassin turns on his bloodthirsty protégé, and takes the child under his protection.

Jerem is 16, the adopted son of a well to do merchant family from a backwater village. He chafes under the sameness of his life, craves adventure. He has secretly applied to the imperial academy.

On the eve of his liberation, Jerem discusses his plan with his only two friends.

Once again he is tormented by his bully. Once again he cowers.

An odd man comes to his home. Everyone is careful around him. He inspects Jerem like a horse trader, grills him on many subjects. The man shows grudging satisfaction with Jerem’s answers. 

He orders Jerem to take up a sword and is obviously displeased at the results. This time Jerem’s father does not demur. “I'll not go back there. Not even for you,” he says.

The man considers as he inspects Jerem, keeping his own council. Finally, he announces Jerem will continue his training at the monastery at [?] a barren and desolate outpost of ascetic monks as far from civilization as it is possible to get within the empire. Jerem is horrified, confused. What training?

Jerem reveals his own plans to escape to the imperial academy. He has applied, and they are announcing tomorrow. He will be departing for the capital within days. The odd man smiles, perhaps in pity. “I see.”

Jerem rises the next day demanding answers from his parents. Who is this man? They refuse.

Jerem attends the academy announcement. He is supremely confident of his acceptance. Names are called. His name is not.

His bully laughs and mocks him. Jerem punches him, beats him savagely. Runs away in horror at his own brutality.

His friends find him in seclusion. They try to console him but he wallows in self pity.
